NoteBooks Statistics and Machine Learning
=========================================
Initially forked from [original](https://github.com/leonvanbokhorst/NoteBooks-Statistics-and-MachineLearning)
I am upgrading these to work with Python 3.x and adding more content/notebooks as I go along.
This is to serve as comprehensive notes and references.
Hopefully others benefit from it as much as I did.
